### 🎂 Happy Birthday, Anu! 💫

You were the **first friend I made in college** — and that will always mean something incredibly special to me.  
From awkward first hellos to becoming **van mates, bench buddies, and partners in crime** for every little thing... you’ve been by my side through it all.

You made college feel like home.  
You made even the dullest days feel lighter.  
And without even trying, you made me feel **seen, heard, and understood**.

I know life can feel confusing at times — full of questions, worries, and "what ifs" — but I need you to remember something:  
You're **stronger than you think, wiser than you know**, and so incredibly **deserving of love, peace**, and every beautiful thing this life has to offer.

💫 **Don’t stress too much. Go with the flow. Trust the universe — it has your back.**  
Let time do its magic, and in the meantime, focus on your dreams. You’ve got so much potential.

### 💖 And hey — never forget this girl right here, okay?  
I’ll always be around to **laugh with you, cry with you, and make you laugh so hard your stomach hurts** (and maybe your cheeks too 😝).

---

I’m wishing you everything good in life — a **career you love, a future that feels right**, and a **partner who treats your heart like gold**.

You’re a **gift**, Anu. And I’m so, so lucky to know you.

---

#### With all my heart,  
**[Your Name] 🤍**
